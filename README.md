# MetroForSteamUnoRW11

## A simple patch for metro for steam to make it look like windows 11

##### This is only a patch! The base skin is made by [DomDrapper](https://metroforsteam.com/), I only modified icons and some parameters!

## Donation
I would be grateful if you could leave me a donation in this link https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=5TP6CVT7XMV4J. Since in my country we are in a pandemic and the situation is very difficult, since I am unemployed and I am living off my mother and the only way I can help her is a scholarship of 15 dollars a month. Thank you.

# Important!
## The skin does not add rounded edges, that only happens in Windows 11! and neither the style of my steam website, it only modifies icons and position parameters of some elements


## Installation Step x step guide

1. Download Metro for Steam 4.4 from official website https://metroforsteam.com/ and Download Inter Font from Google Fonts and install it https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter

2. Unzip and drag it in the \Steam\Skins\ folder found in the Steam folder, if it does not exist create it.

## How do I change the skin accent color and the font?
On the official website of the skin by [DomDrapper](https://metroforsteam.com/), there is a tool to choose from. Then you must download the file and drop it in the skin folder.
